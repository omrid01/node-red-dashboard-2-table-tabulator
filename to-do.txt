To-do for release
-----------------

Temp Workarounds
----------------
- client reload command after server node creation
- widget-load event counter (against duplicates)
- dummy in datastore

Qs to Joe
---------
- Can I get a notification upon client connect/disconnect
- Is there a place with a list of connected clients?
- do I need to clear any socket registrations?
- how to get dash version for backward compatability
- confirm I can send to "input" in node-server and will go to all clients
- confirm I can use node.send from server node
- how do I receive a message from in the server node only (without having it sent to the clients), i.e. override onInput and then call the original onInput

Future roadmap
--------------
- row selection, sorting
- per div CSS
- improve msg collapsing from multi-client
- find table
