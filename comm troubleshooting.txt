Scenarios for "Show Datastore" (send custom event)

1. no clients => none (ok, since command goes through client)

2. 1 client
  - deploy or restart flows while client open - server node recreated, datastore retained, cmd OK
  - restart server process while client open - server node created, cmd OK

3. multiple clients
  - deploy or restart flows while clients open - server node recreated, datastore retained, cmd OK for all but one client
  - restart server process while clients open - server node created, cmd OK for all clients
